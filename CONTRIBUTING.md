# Contributing to Naestro
- Use **Conventional Commits** (feat, fix, docs, refactor, perf, chore, ci, test, build).
- All PRs must pass CI and include docs when user-facing.
- Breaking changes: open an **RFC** issue before implementation.
- Add/update tests or validation scripts for logic changes.
- Keep `providers.yaml` schema-valid (`npm run validate:providers`).
