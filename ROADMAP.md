# Naestro Roadmap

## 0. Mission
Our mission is to bring reasoning and generative intelligence into every creative workflow. 2025 is about turning Naestro from a research project into a stable platform with crisp APIs and predictable performance.

## 1. Core Architecture
Establish modular runtime and typed contracts across subsystems; finish shift to Graphiti.

## 2. Language Capabilities
Release multi-lingual semantic layer; integrate symbolics with neural models.

## 3. Data & Knowledge
Automate ingestion, labeling, and governance of knowledge artifacts; deliver reproducible datasets.

## 4. Tooling
Ship CLI and Studio improvements; enable one-command deployments.

## 5. Extensibility
Add plugin system, custom operator DSL, and public extension registry.

## 6. Security & Privacy
Implement end-to-end encryption, secure enclaves, and granular permissions.

## 7. Collaboration
Real-time shared canvases and presence indicators across clients.

## 8. Performance
GPU pipeline for inference, streaming execution, and cost dashboards.

## 9. Observability
Tracing, metrics, and event replay for every workflow.

## 10. Edge & Mobile
Lightweight runtime for on-device tasks and offline operation.

## 11. Community
Launch education portal, host design challenges, and expand governance council.

## 12. Research
Explore long-horizon reasoning, hybrid search, and emergent agent behavior.
