# Naestro ROADMAP — Evolving Autonomous System (ASI Trajectory)


# North Star

Naestro evolves from a goal-driven multi-agent orchestrator into a continuously self-improving autonomous system that can:

1. decompose open-ended goals;
2. coordinate local+cloud LLMs and tools;
3. write, test, and ship production-quality code;
4. operate safely with strong observability and policy gates;
5. self-improve via guarded self-edits validated by rigorous evaluations.

---

# Technical Foundation

High-performance async Python backend (FastAPI, Uvicorn, asyncio) with Redis (cache/queues), Celery (background tasks), PostgreSQL (+pgvector), Kubernetes (Helm), OpenTelemetry + Prometheus + Grafana (observability), Sentry (errors). Policy & auth via OPA/Casbin, Keycloak, Vault. LLM integration through AnyLLM (plus official SDKs). Safety via NeMo Guardrails / Guardrails AI.

---

## 1) Target Properties (what “evolving ASI” means)

1. **General goal execution** — NL objectives → typed plans (DAGs) with budgets, SLAs, success criteria; agentic RAG and adaptive sources.
2. **Model+tool orchestration** — Router chooses LLM/tools using live telemetry + historical win-rates; bandit updates; federated learning for privacy.
3. **Formalized self-improvement** — Self-PRs (prompt/router/config/test deltas) gated by evals/canary; AlphaEvolve-style optimization for hot paths.
4. **Safety-first autonomy** — Capability bounds, consent layers, provable rollback, constitutional principles, guardrails, HITL.
5. **Observability & provenance** — Logs, metrics, traces; signed artifacts; time-travel debugging; metacognitive narratives.
6. **Hallucination-resilience** — Retrieval-first planning, claim verifier, abstention, CoVe; citation-grounded outputs.
7. **Long-context acceleration** — REFRAG lane for open-weights (16× effective context, ≥10× TTFT); bypass for closed APIs.
8. **AgentOps maturity** — Multi-agent plans, HITL evaluation, trajectory/final-response scoring, production robustness.
9. **Preference-optimized policies** — PVPO/DCPO/GRPO-RoC/ARPO/TreePO/MixGRPO/DuPO for stable, efficient routing/reasoning.
10. **Runtime interop** — Pluggable runtimes (LangGraph, CrewAI, AgentScope, AutoGen, Agent Squad, SuperAGI, Semantic Kernel) under unified policy/trace contracts.
11. **Strategic autonomy & compute economics** — Tokenomics credits/budgets; marketplace for skills/agents/data; decentralized delegation.
12. **Advanced cognitive fusion** — Neuro-symbolic (Z3/Prolog), causal AI, multimodal sensor fusion, edge/neuromorphic/quantum hooks.
13. **No-code enablement** — n8n/Studio flows to compose agents & tools.
14. **Human-AI partnership** — Strategic Dialogue Engine, Oversight Council, narrative explanations.
15. **Resilience & efficiency** — Retries (Tenacity), fallback routing, Redis caching + dogpile/singleflight.

## 4) Self-Rewrite Loop (guarded autonomy)

1. **Collect**: dropped runs, OOM, policy denials, P95 spikes, evaluator misses, flaky tests; cost flags; federated failure sharing.
2. **Propose**: minimal diffs (prompt/router/config/tests) → PRs; AlphaEvolve evo-optimization for hot paths.
3. **Validate**: unit/property/metamorphic; golden prompts; offline replays; synthetic suites; hallucination red-team; neuro-symbolic checks; constitutional audits; causal validations.
4. **Canary**: shadow traffic; SLO watch (success/latency/cost/safety); auto-rollback on breach; proofs for merges.
5. **Merge**: sign artifacts, release notes, version bump; council ratification for flagged PRs.
6. **Learn**: update router priors; store counter-examples; offline RL on traces; federated updates.

**Non-goals**: unrestricted self-modification, unsupervised network/files, secret exfiltration, constitutional bypass.

---

## 5) Safety & Capability Governance

- **Boundaries**: Vault-managed secrets; path/domain allowlists; sandboxed exec; FastAPI-Limiter+Redis; PII classifiers; off-prem toggle; export redaction.
- **AuthN/Z**: Keycloak (OIDC/SSO), OPA/Casbin RBAC/ABAC.
- **Kill switches**: pause runs; revoke tokens; quarantine models/tools.
- **Compliance**: immutable audit logs; consent receipts; Safety Index alignment; council audits.
- **Truthfulness gates**: retrieval-first, inline citations, abstain-on-uncertainty, post-validation with NeMo Guardrails.
- **Formal proofs**: TLA+/Coq for Policy Engine & Self-PR merge gate.
