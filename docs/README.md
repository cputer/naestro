# Naestro Documentation Index

This repository snapshot introduces a lightweight runtime for experimentation.
Use the following guides to explore the new building blocks:

- [Roles and Debate](patterns/roles-and-debate.md) – modelling predictable multi-role discussions.
- [Message Bus](core/message-bus.md) – wiring middleware into orchestrations.
- [Governor](governance/governor.md) – composing deterministic policy checks.
- [Model Routing](routing/model-routing.md) – scoring models against task profiles.
- [Trading Pack](packs/trading.md) – an end-to-end example combining all primitives.

Architecture decisions are documented under `docs/adr` with ADR-001 describing
the trading-inspired patterns used throughout the examples.
